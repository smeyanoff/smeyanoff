# 🎒 My Projects

## ML
To get a better understanding of my projects, I have split my repositories into ML areas with short descriptions.

### 🎞 Computer Vision

#### 🚗 Car Number Detection
This project focuses on detecting car license plates and recognizing the numbers on them. YOLO was trained on Russian license plates.
